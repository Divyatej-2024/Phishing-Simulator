  <h2>Level 20: Social Media Phishing</h2>
  <p>You get a direct message on Instagram from a close friend. The message is unusual and just says, "lol I can't believe you posted this embarrassing video of yourself" along with a suspicious-looking link from a URL shortener.</p>
  <div class="scenario-box">
    <p><b>Friend's DM:</b> "OMG is this really you?? 🤣 [bit.ly/random-link]"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="button-container">
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! Your friend\'s account was likely hacked. Clicking the link would take you to a fake Instagram login page. Entering your details would compromise your own account, and the scam would then be sent to all of your friends.')">Click the link to see the video</button>
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('✅ Correct! This is a very common account takeover scam. The out-of-character message and suspicious link are red flags. The best thing to do is to contact your friend through a different method (like a text) to let them know their account is compromised.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Message your friend separately to warn them</button>
