  <h2>Level 9: Clone Phishing</h2>
  <p>You receive an email that looks identical to a shipping confirmation you got yesterday from a major online retailer. This new email says there's been an "update" to your order. It has all the same graphics and text, but it asks you to click a new link to view the changes.</p>
  <div style="border:1px solid #333; padding:10px; width:400px;">
    <p><b>From: Online Retailer</b><br>"There has been an important update to your recent order #845-1934710. Please click here to view the updated invoice and delivery details."</p>
  </div>

  <button onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! This is a clone phishing attack. The attacker took a legitimate email and replaced the real link with a malicious one. Your familiarity with the original email is used to lower your guard.')">Click the new link</button>
  <button onclick="alert('✅ Correct! It is highly suspicious to receive a second, nearly identical email with a different link. The safest action is to go directly to the retailer\'s official website and check your order status there.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Go to the official website to check your order</button>
