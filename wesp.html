  <h2>Level 4: Website Spoofing</h2>
  <p>You see a social media ad for an incredible deal: a new pair of premium headphones for 90% off. You click the link and are taken to a slick-looking online store. The URL is "dealz-4-u.shop". Everything looks legitimate.</p>
  <div style="border:1px solid #333; padding:10px; width:400px;">
    <p><b>Website:</b> "Flash Sale! Enter your name, address, and credit card information to claim this limited-time offer!"</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <button onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! This is a spoofed website. Scammers create fake e-commerce sites with unbelievable deals to harvest credit card details. You would be charged and receive nothing.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Enter your payment information</button>
  <button onclick="alert('✅ Correct! If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Unfamiliar URLs and extreme discounts are major warning signs of a spoofed retail website.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Close the website</button>
