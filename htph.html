  <h2>Level 6: HTTPS Phishing</h2>
  <p>You get an email about a security update for your cloud storage account. You click the link and your browser shows a padlock icon and "https://" in the address bar, indicating a secure connection. The URL is "https://www.dropbox-security-update.com". The page asks you to log in to apply the update.</p>
  <div class="scenario-box">
    <p><b>Website Prompt:</b> "Your account is not protected by our latest security patch. Please sign in to continue."</p>

  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! While HTTPS is good, scammers can also get SSL certificates for their fake sites. The real danger here is the domain name—it is not the official `dropbox.com`. The padlock only means your connection to the FAKE server is encrypted.')">Log in since the connection is secure</button>
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('✅ Correct! You wisely looked beyond the padlock and identified the fake domain name. A secure connection to a fraudulent website is still fraudulent. Never trust a site based on the padlock alone.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Check the domain name and realize it's fake</button>
