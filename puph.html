  <h2>Level 12: Pop-up Phishing</h2>
  <p>While browsing a news article, a large, flashing red pop-up window takes over your screen. It looks like a system alert and loudly proclaims: "WARNING! Your computer is infected with 5 viruses! Immediate action required!" It has a button to "Scan and Remove Viruses Now".</p>
  <div style="border:1px solid #333; padding:10px; width:400px;">
    <p><b>Pop-up Alert:</b> "Your system is at risk. We have detected spyware and malware. Click here for a free scan to protect your data."</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <button onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! This is a classic scareware pop-up. Clicking it would either download actual malware or lead you to a fraudulent site asking for payment for a fake antivirus product.')">Click the button to scan</button>
  <button onclick="alert('✅ Correct! Browsers cannot scan your computer for viruses. This is a fake warning designed to scare you. The only safe action is to carefully close the pop-up window or the entire browser tab.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Close the pop-up window</button>
