  <h2>Level 11: Waterhole Phishing</h2>
  <p>You're an avid bird watcher and frequently visit a small, popular forum called "UKBirdSightings.org" to share photos. Today, when you visit the site, a pop-up appears stating that to view the new high-resolution gallery, you need to install a special 'Image Viewer' plugin.</p>
  <div class="scenario-box">
    <p><b>Website Pop-up:</b> "This website has been updated! Please install the new Media Viewer Codec to continue. [Download Now]"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="button-container">
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! This is a waterhole attack. Hackers compromised a niche website they know a specific group of people will visit. The download is malware disguised as a legitimate plugin.')">Download and install the plugin</button>
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('✅ Correct! Unsolicited software downloads, even on trusted sites, are a major risk. The site may have been compromised. You should never install software from a pop-up prompt.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Close the pop-up and leave the site</button>
