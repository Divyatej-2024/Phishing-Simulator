  <h2>Level 8: Angler Phishing</h2>
  <p>Your flight was delayed, so you post a complaint on social media, tagging the airline. Moments later, you get a reply from another account with a similar name and logo. They apologize and ask you to send them a direct message with your booking reference and passport number to "expedite your compensation claim."</p>
  <div class="scenario-box">
    <p><b>Fake Support (@AirlineHelp_UK):</b>  "We are so sorry for the delay. Please DM us your full name, booking reference, and passport number so we can assist you with your claim immediately."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="button-container">
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! Scammers monitor social media for customer complaints. They create fake support accounts (angler phishing) to trick you into giving them sensitive personal data, which can be used for identity theft.')">Send them your details via DM</button>
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('✅ Correct! You should always verify the social media account is the official, verified one (look for a blue checkmark or high follower count). Never share sensitive data like a passport number in a DM.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Check the account's profile and see it's fake</button>
