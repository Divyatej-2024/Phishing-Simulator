  <h2>Level 19: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2>
  <p>You're using the free Wi-Fi at a local cafe to do some online banking. You type in your bank's address, the page loads, and it has the correct URL and even a security padlock. However, your browser gives you a brief warning that the "site's security certificate is not trusted," but gives you an option to proceed anyway.</p>
  <div class="scenario-box">
    <p><b>Browser Warning:</b> "Your connection is not private. Attackers might be trying to steal your information... [Proceed to site (unsafe)]"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="button-container">
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! This warning is a classic sign of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on public Wi-Fi. An attacker is intercepting your connection and presenting a fake certificate. Proceeding would send your login details directly to them.')">Proceed to the site anyway</button>
  <button class="btn-choice" onclick="alert('✅ Correct! You must NEVER ignore certificate warnings, especially for sensitive sites. This indicates your connection is being monitored. The only safe option is to disconnect from the Wi-Fi and use a trusted network or your mobile data.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Heed the warning and disconnect from the Wi-Fi</button>
