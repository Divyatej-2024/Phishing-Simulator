  <h2>Level 7: Email Phishing</h2>
  <p>You receive an email with the subject "Your Package Delivery Has Failed". It's from a generic sender like "Mail Service" and has several grammatical errors. It instructs you to click a link to rearrange delivery.</p>
  <div style="border:1px solid #333; padding:10px; width:400px;">
    <p><b>From: Mail Service</b><br>"Dear Valued Customer, We regret to inform you that we cud not deliver your parcel today. To shedule a new delivery please click here immediatly or your parcel will be returned."</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <button onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! Poor grammar, a generic greeting, and a sense of urgency are all classic signs of a phishing email. Clicking the link would likely lead to a malicious site asking for personal or payment details.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Click the link to reschedule</button>
  <button onclick="alert('✅ Correct! You spotted the red flags. Legitimate companies usually have professional communication. The best action is to delete the email and check any real tracking numbers on the official courier website.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Delete the email</button>
