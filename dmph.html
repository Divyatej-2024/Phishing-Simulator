  <h2>Level 18: Domain Phishing (Typosquatting)</h2>
  <p>You get a "Security Alert" email that seems to be from Microsoft. It says there was an unusual sign-in to your account. The sender's email address is "security@microsft.com". It urges you to click a link to verify your recent activity.</p>
  <div style="border:1px solid #333; padding:10px; width:400px;">
    <p><b>From: security@microsft.com</b><br>"We detected an unusual sign-in attempt. If this wasn't you, please secure your account here."</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <button onclick="alert('❌ Wrong! You missed the typo in the domain name: `microsft` instead of `microsoft`. This is a classic typosquatting technique used in domain phishing to trick you into trusting a fake source.')">Click the link to secure the account</button>
  <button onclick="alert('✅ Correct! You spotted the subtle but critical spelling mistake in the sender\'s domain. This is a clear sign of a phishing attempt. The correct action is to ignore the email.'); proceedToNextLevel();">Notice the typo and delete the email</button>
